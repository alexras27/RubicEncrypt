Rublic encryption is inteded to showcase a novel encryption stratege, with uniquness being the strong suit. It takes a text message, puts it in a 3d array with random characters at the end. Then it generates a random series of movies like turning a Rubik's cube and that becomes the key. it then uses that key to preform matrix transformations. To dycript just use the reverse transformations of the key in reverse.
